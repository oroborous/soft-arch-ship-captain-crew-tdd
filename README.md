# Ship, Captain, Crew
## A dice game for two or more players

### Objective
To win a round, a player must have the highest score after all players have taken a turn. A game may consist of as many rounds as the players agree upon, in which case the scores accumulate from one round to the next.

To earn points, the player must first roll a "ship" (a six die), a "captain" (a five die), and a "crew" (a four die). If the player is able to achieve "ship, captain, crew", then the remaining dice are scored for points.


### Gameplay
On their turn, a player rolls at least five, six-sided dice. If they roll a six (the ship), it is automatically "held" -- that is, set aside and not rerolled. Once the six is held, a five (the captain) can also be held, even if the five and six are both rolled at the same time. Similarly, a four (the crew) can be held only after the six and five are held.

It is possible (and desirable) to roll and hold the six, five, and four in a single roll. No lesser die can be held before the higher are held; they must be rerolled.

The player must reroll all unheld dice until they have used all their rolls for the round (typically three rolls).

Once ship, captain, and crew have been held, the player may continue to roll unheld dice, or they may choose to hold (or unhold) the **non**-ship, -captain, and -crew dice. **The ship, captain and crew dice may never be unheld or rerolled**.

### Scoring
If the player has not achieved Ship, Captain, Crew by the end of the round, they score zero points.

Otherwise, the sum of the face values of the non-ship, -captain, and -crew dice are added to their score. The six, five, and four dice for the ship, captain, and crew are never scored.

### End of the Game
Each player takes all of their rolls before play passes to the next player. When all players have finished rolling, the round ends and scores are compared. The player with the highest score wins. Ties are allowed.

Multiple rounds can be played consecutively, in which case the player's score is added to any previously awarded points. The player with the highest total score is the winner of the game.
